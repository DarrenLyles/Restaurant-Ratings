When we tried to get a table (about 10 or more left empty) the hostess asked if we were doing apps or dinner. I was feeling like wed just order maybe 3 or 4 apps and beers of course so i figured there wouldnt have been an issue. Unfortunately the hostess said we couldn't sit unless we were eating a meal and would have to stay in the bar area. We couldnt even touch the bar let alone eat with all the people there.

This place was recommended by a friend who had been there recently and we were interested in what they had to offer. This place must get packed during Giants games because it's within the vicinity of AT&amp;T Park. We wandered in and sat at the bar. I ordered a cider which initially was okay but it started to taste worse and worse as I drank it. I stopped drinking it halfway through. I was interested in their watermelon wheat beer but it was seasonal and not offered when I was there. Sean ordered a beer off of their menu as well which he seemed to like. They serve food here as well but we had dinner reservations elsewhere so we didn't order any food. It looked like the fried cheesecurds and tater tots were popular. I ended up getting another drink from the menu: San Francisco Mead Co.'s Apple Pie Mead. It was really good, spiced like apple pie and sweet. I much preferred that rather than the previous drink I had. They were launching their new batch of El Sully when we were there, so it was a festive atmosphere. They had people dressed up for the occasion, a mariachi band, and El Sully must have been the special beer of the day. Sean also bought one of their plaid shirts with 21st Amendment emblazoned above the pocket. This was kind of out of the way for us but it was a nice place to check out. I definitely recommend this place for dinner and drinks if you're headed to Giants game nearby. Otherwise it's just ok and I'm sure you could find other bars to try within the area.\",\n",

The plate was visually full. The portion was just right—not too little food, not too much food that some goes to waist. And the taste of the each item was very good. I feel that at $17, the meal was a very good value. I also observed the meals served to others at the bar. The fish and chips looked better than what I see at other brew pubs. The pizzas didn’t appear remarkable, but looked nice nonetheless. The various burgers looked like they were very good. All plates served looked visually full.The menu is online. But per my travel experiences: compared to other brew pubs (in general), the food here is better than what I usually find in a brew pub; the price, relative to food value/quality, is better than I find in brew pubs (in general); and the price for a meal is very fair compared to most San Francisco dining establishments of this caliber.

They were great! We order the chef's meat and cheese board and steak tacos. The food went well with the beer. By the time we left, the place was getting a little busy and it seemed the servers knew everyone that walked it. Overall, a great brew pub that is obviously very popular with the locals.

Sitting in the bar area (the dining area was full), you have to order at the bar for food and drink. There was only one person on the bar, so service was slow and sporadic, as he seemed to be dealing with all drinks orders.Beer samplers available, but nothing to carry them back to your table with. Samplers (5 for $8) seemed pricey. The beer was average - nothing really stood out. Food was perfectly OK, although the pizza seemed a bit small by normal US sizes.Unfortunately, they do seem to encourage families and children.Not conveniently located, a 20+ minute trek from Market Street.\",\n",

I had a flight of their strong beers with dinner. The beer was overall good - standouts were the Red Titan red ale and Beer Ryevolution (Imperial Rye IPA). I could definitely see this as a great after work place to stop and have a drink. The food - I had the street fish tacos which came with a salad and chips.

We stopped by here during a local concert and while the place was packed, we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered the pizza and a burger. The pizza was huge for an individual portion and quite delicious. The burger was pretty good, but costly. The base price was decent, but every additional item was $1.50, so a well appointed burger (with cheese, peppers, bacon, etc) can quickly cost you $17. It does state such in the menu though, so there are no surprises. They were super friendly to our 13 month old child though and brought her a plate of watermelon to eat at no additional charge. That's great customer service.\",\n",
